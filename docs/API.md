# OpenField Server API Documentation

## Base URL
```
http://localhost:8080/api/v1
```

All requests are proxied through the **gateway**, which validates JWTs and enforces
permissions before forwarding to the internal services.

## Authentication

OpenField uses OIDC (OpenID Connect) for authentication, plus password login for
admin-created local accounts. **Self-registration is not allowed.** New OAuth users
are created with `needs_registration = true` and must call `POST /auth/register`
to set a unique username and a nickname before using the app.

### Roles & Permissions

- Roles are granted via **groups**; the first user created in the system (via OAuth)
  is automatically granted the `admin` role.
- Permissions are checked at the gateway. A permission is granted either by the
  user's role or by an explicit permission grant. Permission keys are dot-namespaced,
  e.g. `posts.view`, `chat.send`.

### Get Available Providers
```
GET /auth/providers
```

Response:
```json
{
  "providers": ["oidc", "password"]
}
```

### Password Login (local accounts created by admins)
```
POST /auth/login
Body: { "username": "alice", "password": "secret" }
```

### Register (complete OAuth signup)
```
POST /auth/register
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Body: { "username": "alice", "nickname": "Alice" }
```

### OIDC Login Flow
1. Get the authorization URL:
```
GET /auth/oidc/login
```

Response:
```json
{
  "auth_url": "https://auth.yun/oidc/auth?...",
  "provider": "oidc"
}
```

2. Redirect user to the auth_url.

3. After authorization, the provider redirects to the callback URL with an authorization code.

4. The server exchanges the code for tokens:

```
GET /auth/oidc/callback?code=...
```

When `oidc.app_redirect_url` is configured (e.g. `openfield://oauth/callback`), the server responds with a
`302 Found` redirect to that deep link carrying the access token and user info, so desktop/mobile apps can
complete the login via the OS URI handler:

```
openfield://oauth/callback?access_token=eyJ...&username=openfield&email=user@example.com&avatar_url=...
```

Otherwise (e.g. API-only or web clients) it returns JSON:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ...",
  "refresh_token": "...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 86400,
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "openfield",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "avatar_url": "https://..."
  }
}
```

### Refresh Token
```
POST /auth/refresh
Body: { "refresh_token": "..." }
```
Returns a new access token and a rotated refresh token (single-use):
```json
{
  "access_token": "jwt",
  "refresh_token": "rotated",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_expires_in": 2592000,
  "user": { ... }
}
```
`401` when the refresh token is missing, revoked, expired, or unknown. See
`docs/token-refresh.md` for the full flow.

## Wallet

### Get My Wallet (Authenticated, `wallet.view`)
```
GET /wallet
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```
```json
{
  "balance": 10000,
  "transactions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "amount": 10000,
      "balance_after": 10000,
      "type": "recharge",
      "description": "Admin top-up",
      "created_at": "2026-08-03T10:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```
Amounts are in cents. See `docs/wallet.md` for details.

### Adjust Wallet (Authenticated, `wallet.manage`)
```
POST /wallet/adjust
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Body: { "user_id": 42, "amount": -500, "type": "deduct", "description": "..." }
```
Positive `amount` recharges, negative deducts; a deduction below zero balance
is rejected. `type` is `recharge` / `deduct`.
